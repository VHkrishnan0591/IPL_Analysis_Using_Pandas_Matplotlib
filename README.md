# **IPL DATA ANALYSIS**

## Overview
This repository contains the data analysis of Indian Premier League with past three season data files 2021, 2022 and 2023 and I use pandas and matplotlib for analysis and visualization respectively.

I first perform a primary data analysis like the following
- Top 10 batsmen based on past 3 years total runs scored.
- Top 10 batsmen based on past 3 years batting average. (min 60 balls faced in each season)
- Top 10 batsmen based on past 3 years strike rate (min 60 balls faced in each season)
- Top 5 batsmen based on past 3 years boundary % (fours and sixes) (min 60 balls faced in each season)
- Top 10 bowlers based on past 3 years total wickets taken.
- Top 10 bowlers based on past 3 years bowling average. (min 60 balls bowled in
each season)
- Top 10 bowlers based on past 3 years economy rate. (min 60 balls bowled in each season)
- Top 5 bowlers based on past 3 years dot ball %
- Top Bowlers Bowled Highest Maiden Overs
- Performed Team Analysis like number of wins in 2021 to 2023 season
- Total Boundaries scored by the team in the past three seasons
- Analysed Team Performance analysis on Home And Away Wins

And after completing the primary analysis I combined the results of the primary analysis to pick the best playing 11 with best players in all the possible posistions.

Based on the analysis the best playing 11
- Openers - ShubmanGill and YashaviJaiswal
- Top Order and Middle Order - ViratKholi and FafduPlessis
- WicketKeeper Batsman - JosButtler
- All Rounders - Glen Maxwell and Andre Russel
- Bowlers - YuzvendraChahal, MohammedShami, ArshdeepSingh and HarshalPatel
